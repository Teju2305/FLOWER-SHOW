                <p><b>SEASONAL AND HOLIDAY FLORAL DISPLAYS:</b><br>During spring, displays often feature bright and cheerful flowers such as tulips, daffodils, and hyacinths, symbolizing renewal and the awakening of nature after winter. These arrangements can be vibrant and full of energy, reflecting the joy of the season.
                    
                    Summer floral displays typically include an abundance of bold and colorful flowers like sunflowers, roses, and dahlias. These arrangements evoke warmth and vitality, perfect for brightening up any space and enhancing outdoor gatherings.
                    
                    In autumn, floral designers often incorporate rich hues like oranges, reds, and deep purples, using flowers such as chrysanthemums, marigolds, and asters. These displays capture the essence of the harvest season and the beauty of falling leaves, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere.
                    
                    Winter displays are often characterized by elegant and serene arrangements featuring flowers like amaryllis, poinsettias, and winter greens. These arrangements can be adorned with festive accents such as pinecones, berries, and sparkling ornaments, bringing warmth and cheer to holiday celebrations.</p>
